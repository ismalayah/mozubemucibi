<time>02 Aug 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p><strong>Drew Sidora</strong> [b. May 1, 1985] is another story of an already-established woman joining reality TV on The Real Housewives of Atlanta. And like a bunch of stars in the business, her marriage is also thrown into the scene. But she is not able to make a mark the way she would've liked in her debut season of the show.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>Ever since the start of the 13th season, talks of the divorce between Sidora and her husband, <strong>Ralph Pittman</strong>, has often sprung up. The conflict came from his issue with her joining reality TV in the first place. After having two kids together (and raising her first kid from a previous relationship), her castmates and viewers find him too controlling for her.</p><p>Leaving that for a different story, Sidora's success comes before her days on Disney's That's So Raven, having started as a child actor but barely making her mark until Disney. Regardless, after a number of acting stints, she is still trying to manage her singing career around The Real Housewives of Atlanta. And throughout the years, she's earned quite a pretty penny.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><h2>Drew Sidora's Net Worth and Income Sources</h2><p>Throughout her multi-professional career, Drew Sidora (previously <strong>Drew Sidora Jordan</strong>) is estimated to be worth <strong>$1.5 million</strong>, according to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Celebrity Net Worth’s calculations</a>. It is not comparable to the fortune of her castmates, like that of another singer <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Kandi Burruss</strong></a>’s <strong>$32 million</strong> or recently departed <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>NeNe Leakes</strong></a>’ <strong>$14 million</strong>. But she's worked for it and is still a millionaire.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebsfortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Drew-Sidora-Kandi-Burruss.jpg alt="Drew Sidora and Kandi Burruss of Real Housewives of Atlanta sitting in chairs posing for the photo." width=720 height=537 sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><strong>Drew Sidora and Kandi Burruss for BFFs?</strong><br><strong>Photo Source: <a href=# rel=noopener>Drew Sidora, Instagram</a></strong></p><p>Sidora has been in the industry as long as one can imagine her to be and then some. She started out with acting in a music drama, Divas, starring <strong>Khalil Khan</strong>, at just nine in 1995. However, it wouldn't be until 2003 that she'd ever get a role in anything. But a single episode of What I Like About You as <strong>Angela</strong> was all she needed to kickstart her acting career as a teenager.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p>With a major role in Never Die Alone as <strong>Ella</strong> in 2004 as part of her résumé, she subsequently landed the four-episode role as <strong>Chantel</strong> in Disney's That's So Raven. From then on, it was a streak of roles for the 35-year-old. She was in a <strong>Tim Allen</strong> + <strong>John Travolta</strong> movie, Wild Hogs, in 2006 after the Step Up role. The notable movies she did after them were Man of Her Dreams [2009], B-Girl [2009], She's Not Our Sister [2011], and Hope for Love [2013] before moving back to TV series with the mini-series JD Lawrence's Community Service in 2013.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p><strong>Related: <a href=# rel=noopener>How the Net Worth of RHOA's Porsha Williams Pummeled Through the Years</a></strong></p><p>The highlight of her acting career is often thought to be the 2013 biopic of the girl-group TLC, CrazySexyCool: The TLC Story, in which she portrayed the lead singer <strong>Tionne Watkins</strong>, aka <strong>T-Boz</strong>, alongside <strong>Keke Palmer</strong> as <strong>Rozonda </strong>"<strong>Chilli</strong>"<strong> Thomas</strong> and <strong>Rochelle Aytes</strong> as <strong>Perri </strong>"<strong>Pebbles</strong>"<strong> Reid</strong>.</p><p>After two major TV shows, One Love [2014] and Hindsight [2015], and a lead movie role of <strong>Sandra</strong> in Could This Be Love in between, she moved on to doing only movies to this day. She has a history with <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Eva Marcille</strong></a>, who left the thirteenth season of RHOA and has a net worth of <strong>$4.5 million</strong> herself. They did a comedy-drama, Sister Code, together in 2015 that starred the two and <strong>Amber Rose</strong>, playing foster sisters.</p><p>The mother-of-three did a movie per year since then until 2020 with the two movies in succession, White People Money and Influence, all the while filming RHOA. It was a busy year for the actor regardless of the world.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><h2>Sidora's Music Career Is a Little Hazy</h2><p>Everyone expected to see Drew Sidora living her glam life in movies and music, but her tumultuous romantic relationship hardly let that part of her life be on the screen. RHOA did let us know that she was trying to get her music career going further, but she did get herself involved in it quite a long time ago.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>In 2006, she performed for two tracks of Step Up, ’Til The Dawn and For The Love, even writing the latter one. A year later, she also featured in the song Three Can Play from the movie Three Play That Game and writing it as well. She was one of the dancers in <strong>Sean Paul</strong>’s Give It Up to Me music video, featuring <strong>Keyshia Cole</strong>.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebsfortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Drew-Sidora-Step-Up-Cast-Premiere.jpg alt='(L-R) Alyson Stoner, Drew Sidora, Mario, Director Anne Fletcher, Jenna Dewan, Channing Tatum and De&#39;Shawn Washington arrive at the Touchstone Pictures premiere of "Step Up" held at Arclight Cinemas on August 7, 2006, in Hollywood, California.' width=612 height=380 sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><strong>'Step Up' was truly a step up for Sidora, in music and in acting.</strong><br><strong>Photo Credit: Michael Buckner, Getty Images</strong></p><p>It's not clear if she made any music for a while but she did sign a record deal with Slip-n-Slide Records in December 2008. She released <a href=# rel=noopener>her first single</a> under the label immediately after in January 2009, titled Not Alone, featuring <strong>Atiba</strong>. It was an instant hit and was <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">supposedly directed towards her ex-boyfriend</a> at the time, <strong>Yung Berg</strong>. The pair did collaborate on his music video, Sexy Lady, in April 2007, obviously playing his girlfriend. He's had <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">his troubles</a> since then.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p><strong>Recommended: <a href=# rel=noopener>'RHOBH' Newbie Sutten Stracke Is Not Holding Back to Show You Her Net Worth Empire</a></strong></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p>Sidora has a number of random single releases, the most prominent of which include For the Love, 2007's Slow It Down, 2010's Juke It, and 2018's Winner. There is a mention of an album supposedly released in 2016 but with no mention of a name, the details, and the official tracklist. Maybe expand the discography, at least.</p><p>These days, however, she's had to deal with reality TV and the notoriety that comes with it. She does have a plan to expand her music career but only with the marriage to her husband staying strong.</p><h2>Sidora and Her Husband Ralph Pittman Seem to Be Doing Alright As of Now</h2><p>The 35-year-old has three kids. Her oldest, <strong>Josiah Jordan</strong>, born in March 2011, comes from an earlier boyfriend, hence her name popularly written as 'Drew Sidora Jordan'. She married her current husband, Ralph Pittman, in 2014 and has two children with him, a son, <strong>Machai</strong> [b. June 2015] and a daughter <strong>Aniya</strong> [b. February 2018].</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebsfortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Drew-Sidora-Family.jpg alt="Drew Sidora husband Ralph Pitman with their three kids together." width=720 height=720 sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><strong>"He's mine," she says (in another IG post).</strong><br><strong>Photo Source: <a href=# rel=noopener>Drew Sidora, Instagram</a></strong></p><p>The first thing viewers noticed upon meeting Sidora on RHOA is the conflict with her husband. It's common knowledge that Pittman was not too happy with her choosing to be a part of the show, just for the fact that he did not want to be in the spotlight like that. But he did <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">reportedly say</a> he would support her choice regardless, and it's now the reason they are on Bravo.</p><p>The pair were seen in a marital counseling session which didn't particularly go well, but they've assured that they are still trying to be consistent with the counsels and that they are both fighting equally for the marriage to stay the way it should be.</p><p><strong>Also See: <a href=# rel=noopener>Everything to Know About Katharine McPhee's Net Worth & Income Sources</a></strong></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Fans see a different side of the marriage though, considering she has admitted of talking about divorce on the show. They feel like he's being too cold and inconsiderate to her choices; even the counselor thought he was punishing her to get what he wants. He has talked about depression and anxiety as the reason for his behavior. Even though the events happened months before they were seen on TV, fans feel he's still unfair to her.</p><p>Currently though, they don't seem to complain about each other because they are sure they care for each other the same way. Considering the bachelorette party for <strong>Cynthia Bailey</strong> that <a href=# rel=noopener>brought up a whole tornado</a> between them. They did have an alright Valentine's Day.</p><p><strong>Stay tuned and connected to <a href=#>Celeb$fortune</a> for more celebrity Net Worth content.
