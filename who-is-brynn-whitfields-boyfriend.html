<time>28 Aug 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p data-characters=363 data-injectable=true data-video=true>This season of <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Real Housewives of New York City</a></strong> definitely threw us a curve ball. It took some time to get used to the idea that we would no longer be following the antics of the OG cast — which included Ramona Singer, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Bethenny Frankel</a>, Countess Luann de Lesseps, and Sonja Morgan — but they will live forever in our hearts and in the archives of Peacock.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=431 data-current-count=431 data-injectable=true>Season 14 of the popular reality TV series was considered a reboot, and we were introduced to six all-new fabulously successful wealthy socialites: Sai De Silva,&nbsp;Ubah Hassan, Erin Lichy,&nbsp;Jenna Lyons, Jessel Taank, and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Brynn Whitfield</a>. And we’ve had some laughs with them, although I don’t see them falling down twice in Mexico drunk on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">tequila</a> – at least two of the new cast members don’t drink. Sigh.</p><p data-characters=266 data-current-count=266 data-injectable=false>One of the most intriguing parts of the show, no matter who the cast is, is learning about the relationships going on. Brynn Witfield’s relationship status is one in particular that has been causing a lot of buzz, as people try to figure out what is going on.</p><h2 id=h-who-is-gideon data-injectable=false>Who is Gideon?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=566 data-injectable=true><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Gideon Lang-Laddie (@gideonlangladdie)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=326 data-current-count=326 data-injectable=false>A long-time New Yorker, Gideon Lang-Laddie was born and raised in London. He works for a company called The Agency, where his “expert negotiating skills and penchant for cultivating long-lasting relationships with clients and colleagues alike make him perfectly suited for The Agency’s culture of collaboration.”</p><p data-characters=284 data-current-count=610 data-injectable=true>He currently resides in Los Angeles, where he works for a private equity firm. He even started a charity to raise funds and awareness for prostate cancer research. And it looks like he enjoys and knows a lot about fancy expensive cars and high-end real estate. So, there’s that.</p><p data-characters=260 data-current-count=260 data-injectable=false>Coming from someone who apparently knows Gideon, Erin shared in her confessional, “Gideon. I wish she would get with him. Just I don’t know why [she doesn’t]…he’s so cute. He is a nice Jewish guy who’s also very cute.”</p><h2 data-injectable=false>But, who is Brynn’s boyfriend?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Brynn-Gideon.png><p data-characters=282 data-current-count=282 data-injectable=false>If you find out, please let us know. It apparently is not Gideon, as Brynn described the two of them as “consciously uncoupled.” But wait – all hope is not lost. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Brynn</a> stated, “There’s a 20 percent chance I might marry him and it’s increasing.”</p><p data-characters=234 data-current-count=516 data-injectable=true>But, you know, they could just be working a second engagement into the plot of the show. Maybe he’ll propose to Brynn in the next episode, amid the backdrop of Big Ben or The Palace of Westminster on the left bank of the Thames.</p><p data-characters=128 data-current-count=128 data-injectable=false>In our opinion, it seems like they would both be lucky. Can you just imagine how beautiful their hypothetical children could be?</p><h2 id=h-what-else-do-we-know-about-brynn-whitfield-s-personal-life data-injectable=false>What else do we know about Brynn Whitfield’s personal life?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=428 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=228 data-current-count=228 data-injectable=false>Episode 4 was an absolute treasure trove of information about the lovely brand marketing professional, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Brynn</a> – which we were kind of expecting (the title of episode 4 is “The Most Brynnteresting Girl in the Room”).</p><p data-characters=358 data-current-count=586 data-injectable=true>We see Brynn having her hair done, which she says she has weekly, and it takes 3-6 hours (!). In this scene, Brynn explains to her stylist — Nadia — the significance of growing up a bi-racial child being raised by her caucasian grandmother, who was advised to take young Brynn to have her hair straightened and relaxed, which also became a weekly thing.</p><p data-characters=349 data-current-count=349 data-injectable=false>She reveals that this was her “only exposure to the black community, to black women. And I saw how beautiful black women are, how strong they are, how funny they were… It’s funny, you know, I think my grandmother was just taking me there to make my life and her life easier. Little did she know that it had a massive impact.”</p><p data-characters=335 data-current-count=684 data-injectable=true>It turns out that Brynn was raised by her grandmother because there was some severe neglect in her home when she was a baby. She recalls a time when she wasn’t picked up and her diaper wasn’t changed for days. She gets extremely emotional when talking about this and it’s implied that we will learn more in episode 5.</p><p data-characters=414 data-current-count=414 data-injectable=true>We have established early on that Brynn is flirtatious with every man she meets, and we see her being quite coquettish with the chef at a Thanksgiving dinner party thrown in her honor — which Sai calls Brynnsgiving — until Sai says “he’s married.” We see Brynn in confessional say “I love a man who can cook, I can’t cook. Maybe that’s why I’m not married yet.”</p><p data-characters=322 data-current-count=322 data-injectable=false>There is this brand of self-deprecating humor throughout the series coming from <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Brynn</a>. This could mean one of two things: she takes it all in stride and prefers to laugh at the situation — after all, she is herself a catch — or she’s using her humor to mask deep pain. Not that I’m a therapist or anything.</p><p data-characters=188 data-current-count=510 data-injectable=false>Then we learn that Brynn is planning a trip to London with Gideon, whom she refers to as her “third ex-fiance.” (Again!) I wonder if she got to keep all those engagement rings.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2TEqbuMoqpmmqKuu6951qGgrZ6Zmrmlv4ybprKeop6yr7CO</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwho-is-brynn-whitfields-boyfriend.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwho-is-brynn-whitfields-boyfriend.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwho-is-brynn-whitfields-boyfriend.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwho-is-brynn-whitfields-boyfriend.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwho-is-brynn-whitfields-boyfriend.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-brynn-whitfields-boyfriend.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./alahna-ly-3.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./alahna-ly-3.html>Alahna Ly Age, Net Worth, Boyfriend, Family, Height and Biography</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./what-characters-will-be-in-the-super-mario-bros-movie.html>What characters will be in The Super Mario Bros.
