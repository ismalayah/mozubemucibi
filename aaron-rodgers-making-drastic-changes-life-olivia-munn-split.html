A source said at the time that the pair "remains close friends and wish nothing but the best for each other moving forward." Sources told <a href=#>E! News</a> the same week that it was Munn who pulled the plug on the romance, adding, "They were great togetherâ€”never had fights, so getting back together can be possible, but as of now, they need time."</p><p>However, sources now claim that it was Rodgers who dumped Munn and that a reunion is unlikely because they'd had problems for a while.</p><p>"The big issue is that Olivia doesn't get along with his family. They think she's controlling," a source told <a href=#>Us Weekly</a>.</p><p>"[They] went through a rough patch [last summer]," the source said, adding, "Their issues have been going on forever." In fact, the source revealed that the couple briefly split before, but gave the relationship another shot ... and it didn't work out this time, either.</p><p>Munn has been rumored to be the reason Rodgers is estranged from his family, as the rift is said to have begun just after they started dating. An insider told <a href=#>Us Weekly</a> that the timing wasn't a coincidence.</p><p>"Aaron is the one that has pulled away from the family, not the reverse," the source said. "When he got together with Olivia Munn, his family told him they didn't trust her and thought she wasn't with him for the right reasons. That made him furious, and he ended up choosing Olivia over his family."</p><p>Another insider said, "She is devastated. She hopes they can work things out and get back together."</p><p>A source close to Rodgers told <a href=#>Radar Online</a>, "Aaron broke up with her because he was tired of all her bulls***. At the end of the day, she was a lot of drama!" The source added, "He has such a nice and caring family. He did this for them. He's mending his family relationships now. Aaron could never have bridged that gap with Olivia around."</p><p>Meanwhile, it seems Rodgers is making "drastic changes" to his life outside the romantic realm. A source told <a href=#>Us Weekly</a>, "He's been getting weekly facials in Beverly Hills and has also hired Ryan Gosling's personal stylist to dress him ... He used to work out in Calabasas with his teammates during the offseason, but this offseason he's chosen to work out primarily with Nick Jonas in West Hollywood."</p><p>The source added, "One teammate said, 'The only time we've seen Aaron this offseason is on TMZ leaving Catch.'"</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmbm9iaYVwrcCrpqdloqSxqLHRrGSmmZueu6h5w6uYrKyZmHqktMCnnp6rXaG2p7GMqKOirpmWeq7BzadkrKicnsFw</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2faaron-rodgers-making-drastic-changes-life-olivia-munn-split.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2faaron-rodgers-making-drastic-changes-life-olivia-munn-split.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2faaron-rodgers-making-drastic-changes-life-olivia-munn-split.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2faaron-rodgers-making-drastic-changes-life-olivia-munn-split.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2faaron-rodgers-making-drastic-changes-life-olivia-munn-split.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2faaron-rodgers-making-drastic-changes-life-olivia-munn-split.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./sofia-richie-net-worth-this-is-how-much-she-is-actually-worth-622511-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./sofia-richie-net-worth-this-is-how-much-she-is-actually-worth-622511-html.html>Sofia Richie Net Worth: This is How Much She is Actually Worth</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./scott-cawthon-net-worth.html>Scott Cawthon Net Worth Income And Earning From Games And Books</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./scott-cawthon-net-worth.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
