<time>13 Sep 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p data-characters=253 data-injectable=true data-video=true>The very first <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Deadpool & Wolverine</a></strong> trailer has finally graced us courtesy of the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Super Bowl</a>, revealing not only the official title of Marvel Studios’ marquee release of 2024, but what might also be the MCU turning point (for real this time!).</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=252 data-current-count=252 data-injectable=false>Indeed, with more faces — both old and new — than we can count and a familiarly-weighty premise spruced up by Deadpool’s cheeky, foul-mouthed, bloody smashing of the fourth wall, this is one trailer that has no doubt whetted many an appetite.</p><p data-characters=249 data-current-count=501 data-injectable=true>And where there’s a whetted appetite, there’s even more hunger; as per usual, we’ve all come out of that first new-Marvel-movie trailer with far more questions than answers, and these seven are firmly at the forefront of our minds.</p><h2 id=h-where-s-elektra data-injectable=false>Where’s Elektra?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/deadpool.jpg><p data-characters=304 data-current-count=604 data-injectable=true>We’ve known that Deadpool’s third outing was going to rope in some cinematic legacy characters by the armful, but none can claim to be quite as big a wildcard as Elektra, who Jennifer Garner will be stepping back into the boots of after last playing the assassin in 2005’s Elektra film.</p><p data-characters=511 data-current-count=511 data-injectable=true>And perhaps it was bold to assume that we’d catch a glimpse of her in the first trailer, but it’s nevertheless impossible to ignore the fact that Elektra’s role in Deadpool & Wolverine‘s shenanigans remains just as big a mystery as ever. Of course, given her street-hero associations and Vincent D’Onofrio’s Kingpin gaining more and more prominence in the MCU, it’s probably safe to say that the site of Elektra’s biggest impact has yet to be revealed anyway.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>How will the rest of the mutants come into play?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/aaron-stanford-pyro-deadpool-and-wolverine.jpg><p data-characters=357 data-current-count=657 data-injectable=true>Speaking of confirmed characters, we know that the mutant rep will go far beyond Wolverine, Colossus, and Negasonic Teenage Warhead; indeed, with X-Men baddies Sabretooth and Toad already set to appear, and now Aaron Stanford’s Pyro officially in the mix as of the trailer, the remnants of the Brotherhood of Mutants are going to need something to do.</p><p data-characters=279 data-current-count=279 data-injectable=false>That something is almost certainly going to involve giving Deadpool and Wolverine a headache or two, but exactly what stake they have in this particular game still isn’t clear yet, and we’re now eagerly awaiting trailer number two to learn exactly what their beef is.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>What’s the story behind Agent Paradox?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/mcfayden.png><p data-characters=160 data-current-count=160 data-injectable=false>One question that was answered in this trailer was the identity of Matthew Macfadyen’s mysterious character, who we now know as Agent Paradox of the TVA.</p><p data-characters=427 data-current-count=587 data-injectable=true>This, of course, leads to a number of questions: What position does Paradox hold in the TVA that gives what appears to be unrestricted access to a case seemingly as lucrative as Deadpool’s? And why are we only just hearing about him now? Could it be that there are multiple TVA branches that we’ve yet to learn all about? Indeed, Paradox could very well be first stepping stone to a brand new field of MCU academia.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Is this TVA pre- or post-Loki?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/loki-tree-what-if-season-2-finale-1.jpg><p data-characters=320 data-current-count=620 data-injectable=true>What’s more, the TVA is looking awfully functional considering what went down in the second season of Loki, which leads us to wonder exactly where Deadpool & Wolverine falls on the timeline. Does it happen concurrently with Loki’s acclimation to god of stories, or is it a bit more complicated than that?</p><p data-characters=235 data-current-count=235 data-injectable=false>Whatever the answer is, it will be hard to involve the TVA in any project going forward without giving a nod to the Loki situation in some way, shape, or form, so we can probably just check that off as another thing to look forward to.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>What happens to Deadpool’s friends and family?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/deadpool-colossus.jpg><p data-characters=302 data-current-count=302 data-injectable=false>So, we know that Deadpool got kidnapped by the TVA, but let’s not forget that he had a sizeable posse of allies, around half of them mutants, right behind him. Might they have reacted to the commotion outside and had a run-in of their own with the TVA, or at least checked to see where Wade went?</p><p data-characters=546 data-current-count=848 data-injectable=true>This could easily be explained away by the TVA dipping out before anyone had time to react, but it’s just as important to note that Morena Baccarin — who portrays Wade’s wife Vanessa, who’s of course present at Wade’s apartment prior to the TVA’s invasion — looks to be pretty high on the casting bill, so it’s no great assumption to say that she’ll take up her fair share of space in the film, further implying that the rest of Deadpool’s allies will show up well beyond the inciting incident.</p><p data-characters=223 data-current-count=223 data-injectable=false>Whether that involves some aggressive pruning at the start of the film is anyone’s guess, but it’s safe to say that Wade’s sudden disappearance won’t go completely unnoticed, nor without retaliation.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Why has Deadpool been having “a tough couple of years?”</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/deadpool-wolverine.png><p data-characters=226 data-current-count=226 data-injectable=false>If the Deadpool & Wolverine trailer has made one thing abundantly clear, it’s that things aren’t quite going as expected for Wade Wilson. That, however, is apparent even before the TVA shows up at his doorstep.</p><p data-characters=418 data-current-count=644 data-injectable=true>Cast your mind back, if you will, to the end of Deadpool 2, where he and a recently-resurrected Vanessa are discussing the possibility of children, to say nothing of storing up an infinite supply of euphoria by slaughtering Fox’s interpretation of Weapon XI before saving Ryan Reynolds from a doomed Green Lantern turn. He certainly had the momentum back then, so where is this apparent struggle coming from now?</p><p data-characters=455 data-current-count=455 data-injectable=true>If Marvel is dead set on leaning into the Jesus bit, maybe Wade is just having a pretty dire existential crisis that he hasn’t quite conquered yet (being a vehicle for meta humor – and even then, one that actually works – probably does a number on your mind). Whatever the case, his struggles are going to spike in a big way over the course of the film, so here’s hoping he packed his game face before being dragged off by the TVA.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>What’s Emma Corrin’s villain plotting?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cassandra-.png><p data-characters=251 data-current-count=551 data-injectable=true>Despite being confirmed as the main antagonist, the only information we got about Emma Corrin’s character is an ominous shot of the back of their head — a head that we aren’t even 100% sure belongs to Emma Corrin (but like, c’mon).</p><p data-characters=328 data-current-count=328 data-injectable=false>Whispers of them portraying Cassandra Nova — the genocidal foil to Charles Xavier — look to be right on the money, but the fact remains that we still have no idea how the main antagonist ties in to Deadpool & Wolverine, which is perhaps the best indulgence of in-universe intrigue that Marvel has exercised in some time.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJobmappZrAtbXOp6pmr5VitaLCxGaYm6elqXqlscCdp6innGLEsLjVnqmippVis7C4y6iuoqaXYsGprdNmoKerkaOybr%2FUqZyrZZKkxK1506uYoqSVp3w%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f7-questions-we-have-about-deadpool-wolverine-following-that-insane-super-bowl-trailer.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2f7-questions-we-have-about-deadpool-wolverine-following-that-insane-super-bowl-trailer.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2f7-questions-we-have-about-deadpool-wolverine-following-that-insane-super-bowl-trailer.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2f7-questions-we-have-about-deadpool-wolverine-following-that-insane-super-bowl-trailer.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f7-questions-we-have-about-deadpool-wolverine-following-that-insane-super-bowl-trailer.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2f7-questions-we-have-about-deadpool-wolverine-following-that-insane-super-bowl-trailer.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./leslie-bogart-bio-wiki-age-height-parents-husband-career-and-net-worth.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./leslie-bogart-bio-wiki-age-height-parents-husband-career-and-net-worth.html>Leslie Bogart Bio, Wiki, Age, Height, Parents, Husband, Career, and Net Worth</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./wynfrey-crews-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography-53285-html.html>Wynfrey Crews Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Biography</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./wynfrey-crews-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography-53285-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
