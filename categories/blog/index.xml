Somehow it doesn't play like that. Why? Maybe it's because McKellar, adapting screenwriters Ken Scott and Michael Dowse and his ensemble cast favor subtlety. The actors put across funny bits with a deadpan reaction or awkward pause, instead of hammering them home by indulging in double takes or hitting key words hard. Gleeson in particular has an uncanny ability to wring laughs from lines that, on paper, aren't innately funny, by delivering them as if they were just another thing to say.</description></item><item><title>10 infamous celebrity death hoaxes, from Lil Tay to Tom Cruise</title><link>/10-infamous-celebrity-death-hoaxes-from-lil-tay-to-tom-cruise.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 May 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/10-infamous-celebrity-death-hoaxes-from-lil-tay-to-tom-cruise.html</guid><description>It is true that news of Lil Tay’s death took the world by storm, especially given her colorful and controversial past.
