Johnson and <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Kevin Hart</a></strong> have shown a chemistry on screen that fans seem to truly enjoy.</p><p data-characters=177 data-current-count=557 data-injectable=true>It could be that Johnson has an allure all his own anyway, and Hart knows how to draw in gobs of fans — and that’s what makes their pairing so natural (or a moneymaker).</p><p data-characters=177 data-current-count=177 data-injectable=false>Or it could be that they’ve only scratched the surface on what could become of two of the hardest working people in Hollywood when they put their stature and stardom together.</p><p data-characters=106 data-current-count=283 data-injectable=false>In reality, they’ve only been buddy-buddy for real in three movies — two of those being jungle-themed.</p><p data-characters=118 data-current-count=401 data-injectable=true>Yet after this year, they will have appeared in five total movies together, with a sixth on the slate, and maybe more.</p><p data-characters=55 data-current-count=55 data-injectable=false>What does the world think of the two teaming up so far?</p><p data-characters=67 data-current-count=122 data-injectable=false>According to box office receipts, the feeling are pretty favorable.</p><p data-characters=78 data-current-count=200 data-injectable=false>Let’s run through all the Kevin Hart and The Rock movies, ranked, of course.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-4-fast-furious-presents-hobbs-shaw-2019 data-injectable=false>4. <strong>Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw (2019)</strong></h3><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=500 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=196 data-current-count=196 data-injectable=false>It’s a Johnson-led film with merely a cameo from Hart. Though it’s a good one — being that the movie isn’t centered around the two — for this ranking, it has to come in last, regardless.</p><p data-characters=87 data-current-count=283 data-injectable=false>You do get the dual joy of having Ryan Reynolds pop up alongside Hart in their cameos.</p><p data-characters=373 data-current-count=656 data-injectable=true>We have Reynolds playing CIA agent Victory Locke as well as Hart as Air Marshall Dinkley, and couldn’t you just mix and match those two along with Johnson and have about a 72% success rate? (Remember, Reynolds and Johnson starred in Netflix’s Red Notice, which didn’t receive great critical acclaim yet somehow shot up the ranks of streaming viewership all the same).</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=45 data-current-count=345 data-injectable=false>Now, bring those two (three, four) together!</p><p data-characters=82 data-current-count=427 data-injectable=true>Maybe, just maybe, it’s a set up for Hobbs & Shaw & Dinkley & Locke?</p><p data-characters=16 data-current-count=16 data-injectable=false>We’re into it!</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false><strong>3.

Sure, it’s a safe bet, as the first Jumanji flm featuring the foursome was fun and made boatloads of money.</p><p data-characters=229 data-current-count=229 data-injectable=false>However, the classic pitfall of sequels befalls this film as well, without enough originality, storyline, and the general lack of things to truly care about making you walk away from the movie not disappointed, but not impressed.</p><p data-characters=168 data-current-count=397 data-injectable=false>All the bits for a sequel are here from famous side characters and cameos (Danny Glover, Rhys Darby, Colin Hanks, Danny DeVito) to rehashing setups from the first film.</p><p data-characters=173 data-current-count=570 data-injectable=true>You could do worse than popping this on brainlessly to stream when you don’t want to cycle through the recommended lists anymore, but you could (and they could) do better.</p><p data-characters=128 data-current-count=128 data-injectable=false>Then again, the movie made three-quarters of a billion dollars ($800M+) and a third film with this cast is already in the works.</p><p data-characters=242 data-current-count=370 data-injectable=false>We sometimes forget that laughs plus special effects with a side of emotion are plenty enough for a full watch these days and throughout the decades, that hasn’t gone out of style. Isn’t that the whole premise of Top Gun: Maverick anyway?</p><p data-characters=149 data-current-count=519 data-injectable=true>Hopefully they work on bringing something else to life rather than a third helping of what we already had (*cough* Jurassic World: Dominion *cough*).</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false><strong>2.

Body switching movies have spanned decades now, and this takes it over the top thanks to a crew who can do just that.</p><p data-characters=173 data-current-count=173 data-injectable=false>We get the “original” foursome as their high school selves and the four actors take great care to embody those traits and mannerisms, while taking them to another level.</p><p data-characters=88 data-current-count=261 data-injectable=false>Maybe Face/Off 2 can do some sort of virtual face swapping and pull off the same effect?</p><p data-characters=130 data-current-count=391 data-injectable=false>In Welcome to the Jungle, Black, Hart, Gillan, and Johnson all do their characters and their avatar characters great justice here.</p><p data-characters=130 data-current-count=521 data-injectable=true>It just about made a cool billion worldwide, getting all the way to $962 million, so no wonder it’s a soon-to-be reboot trilogy.</p><p data-characters=132 data-current-count=132 data-injectable=false>Johnson gets to be strong yet sensitive, humorous and caring, which is basically the pillars of his characters in nearly every film.</p><p data-characters=196 data-current-count=328 data-injectable=false>Hart gets to be funny, insightful, awkward, on the verge of cringeworthy but somehow never getting there, and passionate. Again, kinda like the Hart we successfully see in many of his movies, too.</p><p data-characters=189 data-current-count=517 data-injectable=true>Add them together with the zany and heartfelt Black doing his thing and Gillan perfectly playing shyness in one vain and a newfound extrovert in another and you’ve got yourself a hit.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false><strong>Up next (2022 and beyond)</strong></h3><p data-characters=325 data-current-count=325 data-injectable=false>Later this year we get both actors as the main bill in DC League of Super-Pets. The poster only boasts Hart and Johnson at the top and though we won’t get them on the screen, both have experience doing great work with animation and voiceover — Hart in The Secret Life of Pets and Captain Underpants, and Johnson in Moana.</p><p data-characters=182 data-current-count=507 data-injectable=true>Johnson is playing Superman’s dog, Krypto, and Hart will be Batman’s dog, Ace, which already seems like a better premise than Batman vs. Superman: Dawn of Justice wound up being.</p><p data-characters=233 data-current-count=233 data-injectable=false>Even with the two taking top billing, the movie doesn’t lack in its supporting cast with Keanu Reeves, Natasha Lyonne, Thomas Middleditch, Kate McKinnon, Ben Schwartz, John Krasinski, and Vanessa Bayer all part of the crew too.</p><p data-characters=82 data-current-count=315 data-injectable=false>After that, we’ll most likely see them pairing up again in a third Jumanji film.</p><p data-characters=268 data-current-count=583 data-injectable=true>For those that watched both Jumanji’s, the scene during the credits of The Next Level set us up for the next film to come and for the cast to expand. Audiences are even in for a treat with some call-backs or crossovers with the original film starring Robin Williams.</p><p data-characters=268 data-current-count=268 data-injectable=false>Perhaps both Hart and Johnson will learn what they truly have beyond just improvising and getting to be in the same film together and can take a project to a new level — one that brings about the unique quality bubbling just below the surface in all the films above.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJomKWkXaCyt7XNZp%2BaqqRirq%2BwjK2fnmWipLCsecyoraKdo2K%2ForrKnpto</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fall-kevin-hart-and-the-rock-movies-ranked.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fall-kevin-hart-and-the-rock-movies-ranked.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fall-kevin-hart-and-the-rock-movies-ranked.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fall-kevin-hart-and-the-rock-movies-ranked.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fall-kevin-hart-and-the-rock-movies-ranked.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fall-kevin-hart-and-the-rock-movies-ranked.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./every-jack-champion-movie-and-all-his-upcoming-movie-projects.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./every-jack-champion-movie-and-all-his-upcoming-movie-projects.html>Every Jack Champion movie and all his upcoming movie projects</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./slaking-dragons-exalted-103.html>Slaking (Dragons Exalted 103) - Bulbapedia, the community-driven Pokmon encyclopedia</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./slaking-dragons-exalted-103.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
